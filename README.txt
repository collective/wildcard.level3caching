Introduction
============

This package provides CDN Level(3) support with Plone. It provides a configuration
panel to allow you to automatically invalidate the cache for an object or 
to do it manually and to configure your API settings.

To use this you need to setup your own API key, secret and figure out access group
and property name for what you'd like to invalidate.

with Level(3) or any other CDN.
